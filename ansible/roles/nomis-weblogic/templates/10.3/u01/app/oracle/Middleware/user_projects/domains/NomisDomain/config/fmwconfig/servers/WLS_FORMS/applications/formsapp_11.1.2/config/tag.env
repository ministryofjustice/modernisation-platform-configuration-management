# Settings for Reports
# -------------------------------
# NOTE: This setting is only needed if Reports applications
# are called from Forms applications
# However, because of bug 2336698 where a report is started from
# a forms debugger session with an already running JVM, then
# the report's class path should also be included in the forms
# class path.
# We no longer need to set REPORTS_CLASSPATH as forms will
# always start the JVM before calling reports.
# 
# 
# Settings for Forms tracing and logging
# -----------------------------------------------
# Note: By default tracing and logging directory is
# $ORACLE_INSTANCE/FormsComponent/forms/trace
# To change the trace directory this entry has to be uncommented and set to
# desired directory for tracing and logging
# 
#FORMS_TRACE_DIR=%ORACLE_INSTANCE%/FormsComponent/forms/trace
# 
# 
# Settings for Javascript events
# -----------------------------------------------
# Note: If this variable is set to false then the triggers and
# built-ins associated with javascript events are disabled
#

# 
# Path for shared library objects
#   This is highly platform (if not machine) specific !  At install time
#   <percent>LD_LIBRARY_PATH<percent> should be replaced with the
#   actual value of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable (at install
#   time).  That should ensure we have the paths for such necessities as
#   the motif and X11 libraries.
# Explanations:
#   - Reports needs the path for libjava.so
#     (.../jre/lib/sparc)
#   - Forms needs two paths to the jre, for libjvm.so and libhpi.so
#   - In JDK 1.4.1 the location of libjvm.so is lib/sparc (there is no
#     classic directory) so we do not include the .../classic directory
#     below. There are other versions of libjvm.so (in directories server,
#     client and hotspot) but we will use the version in lib/sparc for now.
