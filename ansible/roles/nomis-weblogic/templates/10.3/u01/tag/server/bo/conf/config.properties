#P-NOMIS passes a clustername read from SYSTEM_PROFILES (not normally used anymore).
#   If the value passed equals the value of properties rws.sso.pastarg.sysdown or rws.sso.pastarg.patching then the rws.sso.errormsg or rws.sso.patchmsg message will be given.
#   The value can also be suffixed with -n (i.e. hyphen followed by a number representing minutes to check back).
#      If this suffix is included, and n is a valid number, then the rws.sso.tryagainmsg message will be appended with the {mins} placeholder formatted depending on the value of n.
#      If n is < 10 then 10 minutes is assumed.
#      If n is < 60 then the {mins} placeholder is formatted as "n minutes", if n is divisible by 60 then the placeholder is formatted as "y hours" otherwise the format is "y hours x minutes".
