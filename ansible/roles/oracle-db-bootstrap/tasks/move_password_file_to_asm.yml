# Move the Password File to ASM if not already there.
# This is required to ensure that even if passwords are rotated between the prepare-clone and switch-clone phases,
# the updated password file is still available for use.   If not in ASM then it would need to be re-copied between
# homes.   If it is in ASM then it is independent of which home is currently in use.
