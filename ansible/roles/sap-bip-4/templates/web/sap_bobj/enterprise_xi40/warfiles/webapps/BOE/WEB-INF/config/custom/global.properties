# DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE!
# To customize any of the settings, create a new file in <BOE_Install_Dir>\<Enterprise_DIR>\warfiles\webapps\BOE\WEB-INF\config\custom
# and run wdeploy. Only changes in the custom directory will be maintained over patches. The new file has to have the same file name
# as this one and shall only contain the properties that you would like to customize.

# DEFAULT GLOBAL PROPERTIES
#
# This file contains DEFAULT global properties.  A property defined here can have one of two scopes:
#
# Scope: global
# - It can be overridden at a global level by specifying a value in the CUSTOM global.properties file.
#
# Scope: application:
# - In addition to being overridable globally, it can also be on a per app basis.
# - This could happen in 1 of 2 ways:
#   o  It can be set in the app's CUSTOM config properties file.
#   o  Alternatively it could be set internally by the app, in which any custom value
#     (either globally or for that application) is ignored. This would be indicated by comments in the
#      application's DEFAULT properties file
