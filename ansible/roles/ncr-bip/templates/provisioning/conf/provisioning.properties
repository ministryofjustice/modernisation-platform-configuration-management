#DefaultDaysToProvision - The default number of days that the provisioning will run for. 
#                         Must be a positive number greater than 0.
#                         (E.g. setting this parameter to 1 will result in changes within the previous 24 hours being picked up.)
#                         NOTE: An argument being passed to the provisioning process via the CMC will override this value.

#                         true to populate the Provisioning_BOE_Groups table from the BOE system.
#                         false to perform provisioning without pre-populating the table.
PopulateBOEGroupsTable=true


#BOEGroupsToExclude - A comma separated list of BOE groups to exclude from the provisioning processing.
#                     As a result these groups and any users within them will not be provisioned, unless they are a member of other group(s).
#                     This list should only be used for groups containing BOE administrators or non-CNOMIS users.
#
#                     System groups: 'Administrators','Everyone','Cryptographic Officers','Data Federation Administrators','Monitoring Users','QaaWS Group Designer','Report Conversion Tool Users','Translators','Universe Designer Users'

#                          true to clear and update the groups for the admin user (i.e. removing them from the Administrators group, they will only belong to groups/roles specified in CNOMIS)

#                                      If the user is re-enabled and needs admin access then they will need to be added back into the Administrators group manually.
#                                 false to leave the user in the Administrators group if the user is disabled.

#Override_970_980 - If a user belongs to both roles 970 and 980 on CNOMIS, Provisioning will only add the user to the group specified by this parameter.
#                   Value must be either 970 or 980. If the value is anything else other than one of these values, 980 (i.e. refresh only user) will be used.

#                          false to not create a new BOE user account if their NOMIS account is disabled.
