# cms.clusters: comma separated list of cluster names.  Each cluster in the above list requires its own parameter: key = cms.clusters.<clustername> (without the @), value = comma separated list of cms servers. Note: Each param-name must match case with the corresponding value in cms.clusters.  No port needs to be given for a server.  If none is given, then the default port 6400 is assumed.
#cms.clusters.samplecluster=cmsone:6400, cmstwo
#cms.clusters.samplecluster2=cms3, cms4, cms5
