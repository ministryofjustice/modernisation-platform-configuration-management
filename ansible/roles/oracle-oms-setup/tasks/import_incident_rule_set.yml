            As of OEM 13.5 Oracle does not provide an API to order Inicident Rules.
            This step must therefore be done manually through the Console as follows:

              Setup --> Incidents --> Incident Rules --> Reorder Rule Sets

              Place HMPPS OEM Rule Set in Order position 1 so that it supercedes any
              other Rule Sets which have been defined.

            As of OEM 13.5 Oracle does not provide an API to add Notification Rules to Inicident Rules.
            This step must therefore be done manually through the Console as follows:

             Setup --> Incidents --> Incident Rules

             1. Select HMPPS OEM Rule Set and Edit

             2. Select "Notification rule to slack" and Edit

             3. Next to Step 2 of 4, and Add.   Under Advanced Notifications check the box
                beside SLACK_NOTIFICATION (PL/SQL Procedure), and Continue.

             4. Next --> Next --> Continue --> Save

             Repeat the above for "Send Slack Notification for All Data Guard Incidents"
